I have npm installed Node-Spotify-API, Axios, Moment, and DotEnv.
I am not entirely sure how to set up/monkey with the OMDB API (keys etc),
and I am quite aware that we have been doing this for ever in class.
I only expect Bands In Town API to be slightly different.

Next to do:
1.  Get my keys, log them here
2.  Review usage of API in activities we have done.  Mimic each
3.  Perform a hard coded API access and console.log it.
4.  Make a switch statement for each.
5.  Put it all together.
6.  Review the requirements.
